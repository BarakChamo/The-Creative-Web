#### Prep
1. Signup for GitHub

Sign up for a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).


2. Install Git on development computer

Follow the installation process for your OS [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


3. Install Visual Studio Code

Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) and follow the installation.
Install the VS Code React Native Extensions from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native).


4. Install Node.js and the Node Package Manager (`npm`)

Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), the installation includes `npm`.


#### Sharing work
Being creative on the web means being able to share our work with the world,
so let's begin practicing some good "putting it out there" habbits.

For your first assignment, please create your own GitHub class repository,
call it "My Creative Web", "JS Sketches", "Whatever", just make sure it's `PUBLIC`!

Then, follow the instruction to enable GitHub pages on your repo:
[GitHub pages guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

Your first assignment is to find a creative experience or experiment
and attempt to recreate it in any web technology you're comfortable with.
If you liked Three.js, use it. If not, use P5.js or anything else you want.

Please post the assignment to your repo as a public GitHub page and post
the link in the [Assignment 1 issue comments](https://github.com/BarakChamo/The-Creative-Web/issues/2).
