### The Elements of Music
Music can be described in many ways and analyzed from perspectives ranging
from caltural influences to mathematical relationships, all of which open up a world of musical exploration.

For the purposes of our short introduction to music and sound on the web, I think we can benefit from a simpler definition:
`Music is organized sound`, coined by *Edgard Var√®se*.

Thinking of music in terms of organization and structure gives us a framework for both analysis and construction, and understanding the relationships between the different elements mean we can start thinking of algorithmic approaches for incorporating sound and music in our work.

So, what are the elements of music? Let's begin with a subset:
- Pitch
- Duration and form
- Timbe

These elements come together in more complex forms to create the language and terms we use to describe music:
- Notes
- Chords
- Progressions
- Texture
